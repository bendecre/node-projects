Javascript used to be only used in a browser, not as a stand alone programming language.
Can make web servers that connect with databases with NodeJS.
Javascript code can be run on server, not forced to be run on client browser.
Node provides tools like libraries for setting up web server.
Chrome provides javascript code to it's V8 javascript engine and gets the code back.
Node does the same, with the same engine.
Javascript code is sent to V8 engine, which executes C++ functions and the V8 engine returns Javascript code again.
Javascript functions are sent with C++ Bindings. Example: fs.read javascript function, which reads files from a disk, is sent with a c++ binding since c++ can read files from a disk, while javascript cannot.
